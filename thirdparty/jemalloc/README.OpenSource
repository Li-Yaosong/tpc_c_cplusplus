        "Description": "jemalloc is a high-performance, low-fragmentation memory allocator, originally developed by the FreeBSD project, designed to address the performance bottlenecks and memory fragmentation issues of traditional memory allocators (such as glibc's malloc) in high-concurrency and long-running scenarios. It is widely used in various high-performance applications (such as Redis, Firefox, MySQL, Cloudflare services, etc.), and performs particularly well in multithreaded environments."
